# Predicting High School Graduation 
  A common theme of most prevailing research of early childhood development, is that humans are inherently born with (nature) and develop throughout early stages of life (nurture), specific skills, abilities and characteristics that are highly correlated and therefore predictive of ability to succeed in high school. Our research question focuses specifically on predicting high school graduation, this is an important subject to study because if we can accurately predict high school graduation, we can then narrow down the predictive variables that have the greatest correlation with our outcome of interest. Researching inherent characteristics and circumstantial influences on studentsâ€™ academic and subsequent life successes can help influence future public policy decisions.
